# camera-pipeline-UI

Please note that the executable in .\dngOneExeSDK\ folder is for Windows. Dr. Derya Akkaynak and Dr. Ben D. Singer from Princeton University produced an executable for macOS. If you are using macOS, you need to replace **dngOneExeSDK** with **executable_for_macOS** in the Matlab script camera_pipeline.m
